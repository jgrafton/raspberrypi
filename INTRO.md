about the talk
--------------
News of the Raspberry Pi took the geek world by storm in late 2011.   Surprisingly, a $35 ARM based computer capable of running a full blown version of Linux caught the attention of ordinary folks and computer insiders alike.  So many people wanted to get their hands on one, order wait times measured in months shortly after release.  During the first year of its existence, the Raspberry Pi Foundation estimates they sold nearly half a million of the little computers.  Thankfully, Raspberry Pi's are finally easy to come by and the internet is full of people doing interesting things with them.

This talk will cover the Raspberry Pi's short history and thinking behind creating a learning platform anyone can pick up and play with.  Then we'll get to the good stuff, what hardware you need to get started, how to install Raspian Linux, and how to use it as a media center running XBMC.

We will also *attempt* to demo many of the things we talk about.
