# Raspberry Pi Presentation by the SVLUG
Presented by John Grafton and Markus 


## Introduction
The Raspberry Pi began as a project to mimic the effect Acorn's BBC Micro had on children in the early 1980's.  The goal of the project was to create a computer that could be used as a teaching tool to impart the vagaries of computer programming to kids.
